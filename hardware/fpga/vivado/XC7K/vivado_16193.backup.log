WARNING: [Route 35-198] Port "address[1]" does not have an associated HD.PARTPIN_LOCS, which will prevent the partial routing of the signal "address[1]". Without this partial route, timing analysis to/from this port will not be accurate, and no routing information for this port can be exported.
WARNING: [Route 35-198] Port "address[2]" does not have an associated HD.PARTPIN_LOCS, which will prevent the partial routing of the signal "address[2]". Without this partial route, timing analysis to/from this port will not be accurate, and no routing information for this port can be exported.
WARNING: [Route 35-198] Port "address[0]" does not have an associated HD.PARTPIN_LOCS, which will prevent the partial routing of the signal "address[0]". Without this partial route, timing analysis to/from this port will not be accurate, and no routing information for this port can be exported.
WARNING: [Route 35-197] Clock port "clk[0]" does not have an associated HD.CLK_SRC. Without this constraint, timing analysis may not be accurate and upstream checks cannot be done to ensure correct clock placement.
WARNING: [Route 35-198] Port "rst[0]" does not have an associated HD.PARTPIN_LOCS, which will prevent the partial routing of the signal "rst[0]". Without this partial route, timing analysis to/from this port will not be accurate, and no routing information for this port can be exported.
WARNING: [Route 35-198] Port "valid[0]" does not have an associated HD.PARTPIN_LOCS, which will prevent the partial routing of the signal "valid[0]". Without this partial route, timing analysis to/from this port will not be accurate, and no routing information for this port can be exported.
