The IObundle KNN core provides an implementation of the KNN algorithm. 
It is written in C language and includes a peripheral described in Verilog that accelerates the execution.
This circuit allows the processing of multiple test points in parallel, thereby increasing the performance
of the algorithm implementation in comparison with the original sequential execution on the software end.
